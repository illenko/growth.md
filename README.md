## What is growth.md?

**growth.md** turns your career development into a git repository. Just like `backlog.md` manages tasks, `growth.md` manages your skills, goals, and learning journey.

- 📝 **Markdown-native** — every skill, goal, and milestone is a plain `.md` file
- 🤖 **AI-powered** — personalized learning paths generated by LLMs
- 🎯 **Git-based** — version your career progression, branch your learning experiments
- 🚀 **Local-first** — 100% private, works offline, you own your data
- 💻 **CLI-first** — developer-friendly command-line interface
- 🆓 **MIT-licensed** — free and open source
