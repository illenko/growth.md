# growth.md

**Git-native Career Development & Learning Path Manager for Engineers**

> Track your engineering growth, build personalized learning paths, and level up your career—all in plain Markdown files powered by AI.

## What is growth.md?

**growth.md** turns your career development into a git repository. Just like `backlog.md` manages tasks, `growth.md` manages your skills, goals, and learning journey.

- 📝 **Markdown-native** — every skill, goal, and milestone is a plain `.md` file
- 🤖 **AI-powered** — personalized learning paths generated by LLMs via MCP
- 🎯 **Git-based** — version your career progression, branch your learning experiments
- 🚀 **Local-first** — 100% private, works offline, you own your data
- 💻 **Cross-platform** — CLI-first with optional web UI
- 🆓 **MIT-licensed** — free and open source

## Core Concepts

### Skills
Individual competencies you're developing (e.g., "Machine Learning", "Distributed Systems", "System Design")

### Goals  
High-level career objectives (e.g., "Become ML Engineer", "Master Backend Architecture")

### Learning Paths
AI-generated, personalized sequences of skills and resources tailored to your goals and current level

### Milestones
Significant achievements in your journey (e.g., "First ML model in production", "Led system design review")

### Resources

## FAQ

**Q: How is this different from backlog.md?**  
A: backlog.md manages project tasks; growth.md manages career development. Different domain, similar philosophy.

**Q: Do I need to use Git?**  
A: Yes, growth.md is git-native. But it handles git operations for you.

**Q: Does the AI require API keys?**  
A: For AI features, you'll need OpenAI/Anthropic API key. But basic tracking works without AI.

**Q: Can I share my learning path?**  
A: Yes! Just push your growth/ folder to GitHub. Others can fork your path.

**Q: Will there be a hosted version?**  
A: No plans for MVP. It's local-first by design. But community might build sync services.

**Q: Can teams use this?**  
A: V1 is individual-focused. Team features might come in V2+ based on demand.
